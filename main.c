/**
 * @brief Combines loading a matrix from a file and setting connection rules for a graph.
 *
 * This function takes a graph, the number of vertices, and a filename as inputs.
 * It first calls loadMatrix to load the graph's matrix from the specified file.
 * Then, it calls setConnectionRules to apply the connection rules based on the number of vertices.
 * This simplifies the process of initializing a graph with a predefined matrix and connection rules.
 *
 * @param graph The graph to be loaded and configured.
 * @param numberOfVertices The total number of vertices in the graph.
 * @param filename The name of the file containing the matrix to load.
